# So this is me being a smartie pants, because I know a tiny little bit of python, enough to write comments in python scripts and do the following:
print "Hello World!\n"
# I also know how to run this in the command line!
# $ python lpthw00.py
# Woo Hoo!

# Note that I have also "read" this lesson (exercise 0), I mostly skipped the information for MacOS and Windows, and I am using Ubuntu 12.04, where I have Python 2.7.3 installed. 

# I also liked google, so I will memorize the "python list functions" phrase to google it now and then. (Check http://instagram.com/p/q-tX-1JKGz), hopefully it will work. 

# Ok, now onto exercise 1...
